# History_BEF_grassland_restoration
Data and metadata used to produce all analyses in: Catano CP, Groves AM, Brudvig LA (In Press). Community assembly history alters relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functions during restoration. Ecology 

Data were collected in between 2014 and 2020 at Michigan State University’s W.K. Kellogg Biological Station — Lux Arbor Reserve in Michigan, USA

## Metadata
file: BEF_ANALYSIS_DATA.csv

### Column descriptions:
"site": unique ID corresponding to each 500-m2 plot assigned randomly to establishment year treatments (n = 18; 6 sites / plant.year)

"plant.year": Year effect treatment; 1 of three calendar years when plots (“sites”) were established (2014, 2015, 2016)

"year": Calender year when each site was sampled

"plot": 1-m2 sub-plots where plant community composition was surveyed. Each “plant.year” (i.e. establishment year) had eight 1-m2 subplots (four sampled in 2019, four sampled in 2020; total n = 144). 

"abg": Above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) ; dry weight of plant biomass (g/m2) accumulated over the growing season

"decomp": decomposition rate as the mass lost from a standard substrate (3.80 ± 0.01 g of cellulosic fiber paper)

"floral.cov": Floral resource production; total cover of animal-pollinated flowers in each “plot” (i.e. subplot), summed across three sampling periods (June, July, and August)

"alpha.hill1": Plant species diveristy in each “plot” (i.e. subplot) calculated as Shannon Diversity (exponential of Shannon entropy)

“age”: Age of plot (years since establishment) when sampled

“plant.height”: Maximum plant height (community weighted mean) – mean distance from the ground to the highest photosynthetic tissue averaged across 20 individuals per species

“SLA”: Specific Leaf Area (community weighted mean) – Leaf area per unit dry mass averaged from two leaves from each of 10 individuals

“seed.mass”: Seed mass (community weighted mean) – mean dry mass of 50 seeds for each species 

“FDis”: Functional dispersion

“ANDGER”: Percent cover of Andropogon gerardii in each “plot” (i.e. 1-m2 subplot)

### Column descriptions:
"NMDS1": First non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling axis of composition data (species or traits). Together with NMDS2 make up the (X,Y) coordinates of composition in ordination space.

"NMDS2": Second non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling axis of composition data (species or traits). Together with NMDS1 make up the (X,Y) coordinates of composition in ordination space.

"plant.year": Year effect treatment; 1 of three calendar years when plots (“sites”) were established (2014, 2015, 2016)

"year": Calender year when each site was sampled

“age”: Age of plot (years since establishment) when sampled
